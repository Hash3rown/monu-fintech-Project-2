# Project 2 - Monash Fintech Clique
## Algorithmic Trading

## Wen G-Wagon
## Motivation:

For a long time, stock trading has been thought to be a domain of subject experts. In other words, it was an exclusive domain for professionals who understood the complexities of stocks and currencies. So, stock trading and stock investment remained largely off-limits for those outside of that bracket.

The reasons ranged from lack of industry insights to the limited access to advanced platforms. All of this has changed with the evolution of FinTech. Now, trading and investments have become as simple as the touch of a button on your phone.

## Hypothesis/Challenge:

Among the many popular solutions in Fintech, one is algorithm trading. It is s a system of trading which facilitates transaction decision making in the financial markets using advanced mathematical tools.  It rules out shortcomings of the manual trading system by keeping human emotions at bay. At the same time, traders can eliminate delays and enter or exit a trade as and when there is a cue. These algos offer opportunities for wealth creation and G-Wagon accumulation.

The question posed for this project was Find a Fintech Problem Machine learning can solve. 

#Hypothesis/Challenge: Which of the following four strategies are more profitable for a given crypto asset? We aim to prove that a combination of indicators provides a healthier output than a single indicator.

#Indicator combinations: 

1.	EMA200 VS 50 + BOLLINGER BAND  
2.	RSI + MACD 
3.	EMA200 VS 50 + MACD
4.	EMA50VS200 + EMA9VS20

#Data Collection: 

720 hoursâ€™ worth of data was obtained from a Kraken API.

##Limitations: 

Time: Limited to breadth and depth of what we could experiment with

Feature Selection: At times difficult at Identifying input variables that are most relevant to the task 

API: Constrained by API and the limited data output 

Human Bias: Limited by subconscious bias and how our environment affects out end results The project was also limited to our current skill set. 


##Problems faced: 

API VS API: 

During research it was difficult to find a free API that returned a substantiable amount of cryptocurrency data. There were data access issues with limitations to free software. After consultation Kraken was chosen to be a source to obtain data. 

Time limits were stretched with only two weeks to produce findings. This led to a holistic overview rather than more detailed analysis. 

GOOGLE COLAB:

We encounted a few Google Collab issues. We were unable to all work on the document at the same time.
